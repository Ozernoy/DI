    "First, we will analyze a simple string, like “A good book would sometimes cost as much as a good house.”\n",

    "*Hint*: You need to manually copy-paste the text, straight into the code\n",

    "2. Implement the following methods:\n",
    "    - a method to return the frequency of a word in the text (assume words are separated by whitespace) return None or a meaningful message.\n",
    "    - a method that returns the most common word in the text.\n",
    "    - a method that returns a list of all the unique words in the text."
